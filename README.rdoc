= Xup

Xup is a lightweight Ruby DSL that allows you to programatically write almost
any kind of document. Since it is pure Ruby, it's blazing fast compared to
other markup engines. It is also highly extensible and it is designed
specifically in that way.

Xup provides two default engines to write HTML and YAML documents, but you
can easily write your own ones.
