h1. Xup

Xup is a lightweight markup language. It borrows many ideas to Haml,
Markaby and Textile. I made it to have a language that handles correctly and
easily different kinds of typography.
Xup is written in pure Ruby, making it highly extensible. You can add your own
constructs and tags.

h2. Example

<pre><code>
para <<end :class => "notice"
Hello, this is Xup! This is a simple paragraph. You can include raw HTML in
them.
</code></pre>
